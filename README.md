# Calculator
Calculator using strings which I made for fun.

Takes an example input "((8 + 5) * 6) / 2" and prints the correct answer to that equation. 

## 2025 UPDATE
I have now made an improved version of this 4 years to test my new skills and see how far I've come!

Now features user input verification + "fixing" AND now allows for negative values and decimal values!<br>
2 .exe files can be found under the "Calculator/bin/" directory:<br>
Release folder only includes debug logs from errors.<br>
Debug folder shows every log, so you can follow the nitty gritty details on how it operates!
